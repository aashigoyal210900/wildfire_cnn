This README outlines the structure and contents of our project files, including datasets and notebooks.

## Data Folder
- **final_california_dataset**: This dataset contains the final compiled data for the California part of the project.
- **final_canada_dataset**: This dataset contains the final compiled data for the Canada part of the project.

## Reports
- **Team3_Final_Report**: This is the comprehensive final report of our project, detailing our findings, methodologies, and conclusions.

## Python Notebooks
- **basic_cnn.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
- **AlexNet_Merged.ipynb**: In this notebook, we combined the California and Canada datasets and ran the AlexNet model on the merged dataset.
- **AlexNet_Canada.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on running the AlexNet model exclusively on the Canada dataset.
- **AlexNet_California.ipynb**: This notebook is dedicated to running the AlexNet model specifically on the California dataset.
- **InceptionResNetV2.ipynb**: This notebook is to run the InceptionResNetV2 model on the merged dataset 
- **gaborfilter.ipynb**: This notebook shows the gabor filtering that we tried on the model to see how it filters.
